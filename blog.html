                <h4> Information Processing Cycle</h4>
                <p>In this lesson, I learned the difference between raw data and useful information. I understood how data, like numbers or facts, becomes information when it's organized and makes sense. I also learned about the process of turning data into information, which involves taking in data, processing it, and then getting useful information out. Lastly, I discovered the qualities of good information, such as being accurate, relevant, timely, complete, and unbiased.</p>

                <h4>Introduction to Computer System</h4>
                <p>I learned about the four main parts of a computer system. Hardware is the physical stuff like the keyboard and monitor. Software is the invisible programs that tell the hardware what to do. Peopleware refers to the people who use and maintain the computer, like us. Lastly, dataware is the information and data that the computer processes. Understanding these parts helps us appreciate how computers work and how we can use them effectively.</p>
