        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Being a dedicated BSIT student of Bukidnon State University, I am learning up my foundation in web development and programming. The passion for technology led me to study various aspects of web development, including front-end design and back-end development. I love the challenge of turning creative ideas into tangible digital products.
          If out of the classroom, my favorite hobby is photography since it allows me to bring beauty to the world one shot at a time; I find inspiration in regular things and unique angles while capturing compositions. It showcases my creativity and expresses and shares my vision with many others.
          I'm interested in learning and developing constantly as a developer and as a photographer. I can be excited to collaborate on like-minded projects. </div>
